Nand2Tetris ( https://www.nand2tetris.org/course )

# Purpose of this project:
*Starting out with one primitive logic gate—Nand—and build all the other logic gates from it.*

*Eventually ending up building a general-purpose computer system and a modern software hierarchy from the ground up.*

*Hardware development (written in HDL): combinational logic, memory, ALU, and CPU*

*Software development: assembler, VM, and a compiler written in C++*

# Reflection, by doing this project:
*I learned a lot about computer systems in great depth by experiencing how a simple elementary logic gate turns into a general-purpose computer system.*

*It gave me a deeper insight on how computers actually work in the lowest level to the highest level. Now I truly understand computers more than ever.*

*It was incredible to understand the whole process of how a simple chip just outputting 0 and 1 becomes to represent a complex computer system.*
